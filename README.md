Welcome to **DreamTeam-XI**! This is a React-based application designed to reinforce foundational React concepts through an interactive user experience. Users can select and manage cricket players to build their ideal team, add players within a coin limit, and switch between available and selected playersâ€”all within a responsive, user-friendly UI.

## Project Description

DreamTeam-XI is designed to simulate a team-building experience for cricket fans. Users can add players to their team within a specified coin limit, switch views between available and selected players, and manage their selected team with ease. The app uses fake JSON data for player information and incorporates user-friendly notifications with React-Toastify.
